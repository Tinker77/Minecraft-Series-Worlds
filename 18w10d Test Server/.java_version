# This file tells the server which version of Java to use.
#
# Possible values: auto, 7, 8
# Default: auto
#
# 'auto' will automatically select the best version for the package you have
# selected. Vanilla Minecraft, CraftBukkit, Spigot, and some others benefit from
# performance gains with Java 8. However, some modpacks do not work with Java 8,
# so they will default to Java 7.
#
# Be careful when overriding this version. Using Java 8 with a modpack or package
# that doesn't support it may result in unexpected crashes.
